# carsharing-analytics
Database management with SQLite and machine learning methods to make predictions of an average value of a weekly rate of demand.

# Database Management

The python libraries sqlite3 and Pandas were used to create a new database file from the dataset and transfer the dataset to a table. Within is a variety of queries that organise features from the dataset into more appropriate tables. In addition, exploratory queries were used to find how the numerical value in the dataset, 'demand', varied within specified timeframes. 

# Analytics

The dataset was appropriately pre-processed by the removal of duplicate and NULL values using appropraite methods, and predictions were made of the 'demand' rate. Hypothesis testing methods were used to determine which features of the dataset should be used in both regression and classification algorithms, although some were more accurate than others.

# Summary 

The machine learning algorithms used on the carsharing dataset performed poorly in accuracy tests, due in part to the small size of the dataset.
